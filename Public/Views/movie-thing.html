    <p>While perhaps best remembered as the movie in which
        Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt became star-crossed lovers, <em>Mr. &
        Mrs. Smith</em> deserves more attention than your typical A-list
        action movie. In particular, the film's trenchant critique of
        suburbia, marriage, and the lies we tell each other every day
        make it a relevant, contemporary movie.
        </p>
    </div>
<div>
    <p>As the film is now almost 10 years old, I will be revealing some
    mild spoilers in this review, but it should not be enough to
    disturb enjoyment of the movie. </p>
</div>
    <div>
    <h3>A Slow Death In Suburbia</h3>
    </div>
<div>
    <p>The very first scene of the movie with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie)
    Smith features them in the modern suburban torture chamber:
    therapy in the office of a marriage counselor. While denying that
    they need any kind of help ("Just a maintenance checkup" John
    claims) it is obvious that they are deeply uncomfortable in each
    other's presence, a rawness helped by the fact that this was the
        first scene shot in the film.<a href="#footnote">*</a></p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>As told in flashback, the couple originally met under dramatic
    and emotionally heightened circumstances in Panama, framing
    both their attraction and the cause of their self-destruction. Each
    is an assassin for a rival company, but instinctively uses their
    cover as a civilian contractor from the moment they meet,
    successfully fooling each other for the first six years of their
    relationship. It is this same deceit that threatens the end of their
    marriage.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>In this way the film is very similar to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503/"><em>True Lies,</em></a> the action-comedy
    film directed 10 years earlier by James Cameron. However, in
    that film the deceit was almost entirely one-sided, the
    manipulation significantly more disturbing, and (being a
    Cameron-Schwarzenegger film) focused much more on
    spectacle.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>While seeing each other as equals, it quickly becomes apparent
    that John and Jane are very different people. Jane is reserved,
    precise, analytical, poised; her husband is rough-and-tumble,
    raw and improvisational. Every remaining bit of their energy is
    devoted to maintaining a successful cover: a fine house, the
    latest model cars. But it is only in danger and risk that they come
    alive: life in suburbia is boredom and ennui, and it's clear that
    they can't wait to escape the prison they have built for
    themselves each day.</p>
</div>
    <div>
    <h3>Marching Orders</h3>
    </div>
<div>
    <p>When their respective employers discover who they work for,
    John and Jane are set to kill each other. While these first
    attempts fail, the seething resentment of both wife and husband
    feuls a series of mounting revenge attacks. Their destruction
    comes almost gleeful - you an see them actually <em>enjoying</em>
    themselves when they are hunting each other, in stark contrast to
    the passive-aggressive competition of their marriage - and
    ultimately frees them from the web of lies they have spun.</p>
</div>
    <div id="gun-fight"></div>
<div>
    <p>Having failed in eliminating their rival, the previously inimical
    companies contracting John and Jane temporarily put aside
    their differences to end the problem of the Smiths, driving them
    closer together in survival instinct. The last third of the movie is
    the fight of John and Jane against the joined forces of their
    companies, culminating in a final showdown reminiscent of the
    climax in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/"><em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em></a>.</p>

    <h4>
    Conclusion
    </h4>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>
    While it is not without its faults (in particular Vincent Vaughn's misogynistic,
    eternally frustrated character has become all too familiar in too many movies),
    the film also has a significant share of charm. The chemistry between Pitt and
    Jolie is natural and unfeigned, and the film mixes great action sequences with
    a barbed critique of modern suberban life, and it remains, on the whole, one of
    my favorite films.

    <p>Rating: ★★★★★

    <p id="footnote">
    *Sadly, the rest of the film was not shot chronologically: I was feel
    that doing so imparts an extra emotional verisimilitude to an actor's
    performance, as they can express the emotional arc of their character
    in the same sequence that the audience experiences it.
